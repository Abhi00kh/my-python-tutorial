        <h2>What is Python?</h2>
        <p>
          Python is a high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.

        <h2>History of Python</h2>
        <p>
          Python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC language. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in December 1989, and the first version, Python 0.9.0, was released in February 1991. Since then, Python has undergone many changes and improvements, with Python 3.0 being a significant update released in December 2008 to rectify fundamental design flaws in the language.
